proposal:

> Dynamic pricing in the airline industry demonstrates some of the most effective pricing schemes in business to maximize revenue based on customers' willingness to pay for particular goods at particular times. We propose to develop a dynamic pricing reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize revenue for a single flight with multiple customer segments. We suggest reinforcement learning as it is a model-free paradigm and thus less sensitive to unusual demand patterns, and because it is a relatively new approach to dynamic pricing for airlines.
